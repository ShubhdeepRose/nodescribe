# üîç NodeScribe

This node app uses server-side rendering and utilizes the built-in modules http, fs, url, and path, as well as a custom module. It renders pages on the server before sending them to the client.

## üìù Features


- It utilizes several built-in modules: http for creating the server, fs for reading files, path for handling file paths, and url for parsing request URLs
- It also uses a custom module called replaceTemp for replacing placeholders in templates with data from a JSON file.
- The app uses the parsed request URL to determine which page to serve to the client, with options for the main page, a card solo page, the CSS file, the favicon, and a 404 error page
- The app also uses 'Cache-Control' header to set caching options to the clients.
- The app uses tailwind css to make it responsive and scale to different screen sizes.
